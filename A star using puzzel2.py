"""
This code solves the 8-puzzle problem using the A* (A-star) search algorithm. Here's what each key function does and how it fits into A*:

Function	Purpose	A* Role
accept()	Takes input for start and goal states	Input stage
print_board()	Prints the puzzle	For user display
find_space()	Finds the position of the blank space ('_')	Needed for legal moves
shuffle()	Moves the blank to generate a new state	Creates children
copy_current()	Makes a deep copy of the board	Avoid mutation of boards
h_score()	Heuristic function: counts misplaced tiles	A* uses this as h(n)
g_score()	Path cost: number of steps taken so far	A* uses this as g(n)
f_score()	Total cost: f(n) = g(n) + h(n)	Core of A* algorithm
move_gen()	Generates all valid children states	Expands current node
goal_test()	Checks if current state matches goal	Termination condition
sort_open_list()	Sorts OPEN list based on f(n)	Priority queue behavior
play_game()	Main function that implements A*	Search loop

âœ… 2. Theory: How Is This Related to the Statement?
ðŸ”· Statement:
"Implement A* algorithm for 8 puzzle problem"

ðŸ”· Theory:
The 8-puzzle is a classic search problem where the agent moves tiles on a 3Ã—3 board to reach a goal configuration.
 It is solved efficiently using A*, a best-first search algorithm.

ðŸ”‘ A* Search Algorithm:
A* uses:

g(n): The cost from the start node to the current node.

h(n): The estimated cost from the current node to the goal (heuristic).

f(n) = g(n) + h(n): Total estimated cost through node n.

A* maintains:

An OPEN list of nodes to explore.

A CLOSED list of already-explored nodes.

It always chooses the node with the lowest f(n) from the OPEN list, making it both optimal and efficient, if h(n) is admissible.

ðŸ”— Code and Theory Connection:
Your code calculates f(n) in f_score(), combining real path cost g(n) and heuristic h(n).

It generates valid next states using move_gen(), adds them to the OPEN list, and explores them in order of lowest f(n) using sort_open_list().

It prints the path step-by-step and stops when the goal state is reached.

âœ… Summary:
This code correctly implements the A* algorithm for solving the 8-puzzle problem using:

Misplaced tile heuristic for estimating distance.

Priority-based search guided by f(n).

Backtracking and state expansion via child generation.
