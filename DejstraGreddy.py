""" What is Greedy Search Algorithm?
A Greedy Search Algorithm builds a solution by always choosing the option that looks most immediately promising, without worrying about the overall optimal solution.

It uses a priority queue to always expand the node with the lowest cost so far.

Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm is a classic greedy algorithm for shortest path finding in a weighted graph with non-negative edges.

âœ… Why Dijkstra is Greedy:
At each step, it chooses the unvisited node with the smallest known distance from the start.

It assumes that by picking the nearest node, weâ€™re always getting closer to the destination â€” thatâ€™s the greedy part!

ðŸ“Œ Your Code: Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm (Greedy Approach)
ðŸ”¹ add_edge(u, v, weight):
Adds an undirected edge between nodes u and v with given weight.

ðŸ”¹ dijkstra(start, end):
Initializes distances from start to all nodes as âˆž (infinity), except start = 0.

Uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always pick the node with the shortest known distance.

Updates neighborsâ€™ distances if a shorter path is found.

Keeps track of predecessors to reconstruct paths later.

Prints shortest distances to all nodes, and specifically shows the shortest path from start to end.

ðŸ”¹ get_path(predecessors, end):
Reconstructs the path from start to any node by backtracking using the predecessors.

âœ¨ Example Use Case:
Input:
mathematica
Copy
Edit
Enter number of edges: 5
A B 1
B C 2
A C 4
C D 1
B D 5
START: A
END: D
Output:
mathematica
Copy
Edit
To D: Distance = 4, Path = A -> B -> C -> D
âœ” Greedy nature: always expanded the nearest node first (A -> B, then B -> C, then C -> D).
